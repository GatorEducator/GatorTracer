# GatorTracer

Fetching Json from GitHub with the rule you make to get a dataset the way you want

## Setup

- GitHub: To access to one person's repository in a GitHub organization, that person has to be at least a member in that organization. Outside collaborator permission won't allow our tool to fetch the target repositories. This tool also expects to have a personal access token(PAT) as input. To setup a PAT, please check this [GitHub tutorial](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/managing-your-personal-access-tokens#). Or it's more recommended to use GitHub CLI to authenticate in shell and run `gh auth status --show-token` to display the PAT automatically generated by `GitHub CLI`. For the steps of setting up `GitHub CLI`, please check [GitHub CLI QuickStart](https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-cloud@latest/github-cli/github-cli/quickstart)
- GatorTracer: our tool currently hasn't been shipped on the `pypi`. The only approach to use this tool is by cloning this repository link and run `poetry install` in the root directory of this tool to set up an poetry virtual environment.

## Features

Before everything, please run `poetry install` to install all the required dependencies.

### Token Manipulation

As mentioned above, this tool needs GitHub Authentication like PAT to communicate with GitHub to access to the those target Json files. It's reasonable to assume passing token every time running command is annoying and inhuman. So this tool gives users choice of using a temporary token or a saved token set up by users themselves.

To manipulate or control saved token, please use the official CLI related to saved-token:

- `poetry run gatortracer saved-token --verify`
- `poetry run gatortracer saved-token --save CERTAIN_TOKEN`
- `poetry run gatortracer saved-token --remove`
  
to check existence, save a new token and remove saved token.

Here is an example:

```bash
>> ~/cs/yes/garage/GatorTracer: poetry run gatortracer saved-token --save fake_token                                       
Token has been saved
```

The list of flags associated with `poetry run gatortracer saved-token`:

```md

│ --verify  -v            verify if there is stored gh token                                                                                         │
│ --save    -s      TEXT  save a new gh token                                                                                                        │
│ --remove  -r            remove the currente stored gh token                                                                                        │
│ --help                  Show this message and exit.                                                                                                │
```

### Configuration Manipulation

Here are currently two configuration files: `include.json` and `exclude.json` in charge of included organizations plus repositories as well as excluded ones. `json_fetch` related commands consults those two Json files to find wanted organizations and repositories. **It's required to set up those two files before running any other commands**. P.S.: while both `include.json` and `exclude.json` being specified, only `include.json` will work.

To write one configuration json file, please have a Json file following the template below and using regular expression to specify the content you want to include/exclude.**Here the content of organization should be the url name like `my-org-1` other than display name `My Organization Name`**. You can find url name from url and fetch only the organization part. e.g.: fetching `GatorEducator` in `https://github.com/GatorEducator`

```json

{
    "organization": [],
    "repository": []
}

```

Here is an example of `include.json` that includes all the organizations whose name starts with `allegheny-college-sand` or starts with `allegheny-haunted` and include all the repositories whose name ends with `Yanqiao4396` or starts with `hey` within those selected organizations

```json
{
    "organization": [
        "^allegheny-college-sand+.",
        "^allegheny-haunted+."
    ],
    "repository": [
        ".+Yanqiao4396$",
        "hey.+"
    ]
}

```

To interact with configuration files, use the commands like

- `poetry run gatortracer config --display-in`
- `poetry run gatortracer config --clear-in`
- `poetry run gatortracer config --in-from-file`

An example of usig `poetry run gatortracer config --in-from-file`

```bash
>> ~/cs/yes/garage/GatorTracer: poetry run gatortracer config --in-from-file example_in.json
>> ~/cs/yes/garage/GatorTracer: poetry run gatortracer config --display-in

include.json

{
    "organization": [
        "^yes+.",
        "^org+"
    ],
    "repository": [
        "^sample-repo+."
    ]
}


```

Here is a list of available flags associated with `poetry run gatortracer config`

### Main Feature: Fetch Json

`poetry run gatortracer js-fetch` commands fetch Json files from certain path in certain branch in certain repositories in certain organizations. Here is a list of flags associated with it.

```md
│ *  --token          -t      TEXT  Choose the kind of token to use: either the saved token or the temporary token [default: None] [required]        │
│    --branch         -b      TEXT  The branch where json(s) reside [default: insight]                                                               │
│ *  --dir            -d      TEXT  The directory where json(s) reside [default: None] [required]                                                    │
│    --file           -f      TEXT  The file names in the regex foremoveat [default: .]                                                              │
│    --parse-insight  -p            parsing insight checks to output matrix [default: True]                                                          │
│    --store-path     -s      TEXT  The path where the output files will inhabit. [default: .]                                                       │

## Using BranchWrite

- Using `BranchWrite`: To automatically generate Json files in a certain branch within workflow, here it's recommended to use [BranchWrite](https://github.com/GatorEducator/BranchWrite) dynamically write Json files. For [GatorGrade](https://github.com/GatorEducator/gatorgrade), BranchWrite is extremely helpful to store students GatorGrade reports for future data analysis.
